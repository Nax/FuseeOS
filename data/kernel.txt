# Kernel memory map

0x0000000000000000 - 0x00007fffffffffff: Userland
0xffff800000000000 - 0xffff8fffffffffff: Physical Map
0xffffffff00000000 - 0xffffffff7fffffff: Kernel Memory
0xffffffff80000000 - 0xffffffffffffffff: Kernel Image

Since virtual memory is orders and orders of magnitude larger
than physical memory will ever be, we can simply map all of it
at a fixed address for the kernel to use.
